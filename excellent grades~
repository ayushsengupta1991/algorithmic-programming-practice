This semester you have the potential to get excellent grades. Please do not waste it!! Please work hard. Manage your time efficiently. 

Do not even think about dating or dates till you get a job. Make friends with people you meet and go out with them and have fun. You have made mistakes in the past. That was the past. You cannot change it. Forget that year in Bangalore ever happened.
