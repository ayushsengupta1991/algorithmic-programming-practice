I do not understand why you did chess when you should only have done competitive programming for the last month. And now you only have a month left. The truth is that I was just extremely interested in it and I just could not solve it. 

Listen dude, there is no scene of getting a girl atleast till you go to US. NO SCENE WHATSOEVER. AND THERE IS NO REAL POINT FRETTING WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN BECAUSE YOU CAN DO VERY LITTLE TO CONTROL IT. Remember that no matter what, things are going to be extremely hectic in US and you are going to have to work very hard. There is no point thinking about rockstars and groupies as you have no chance in hell to become a rock star!! And frankly, they are extremely dirty and those girls have severe issues. Plus very low IQ!!

Anyways, do not participate in many contests for the next month(Plus there are not many contests around). Rather for the entire next month(July rather) skeep on solving DP problems, Greedy Problems(basically problems from every different domain) and Div 2 1000s and Div 1 500s. Codeforces Ds(maybe also Es).
