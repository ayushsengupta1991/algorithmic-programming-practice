To solve hard problems follow this strategy:

1) Take up a new and hard problem. Try to solve it, with examples, with different cases. Write code if possible. If you cannot solve it within
20 minutes of starting, read the solution. Understand it properly, mark it and then solve it. 

2) Do more ICPC and IOI problems.
