You just concentrate on your work. Do not think shit. Just keep on concentrating on your work and forget about the time you have wasted. I am sure that if you work immensely hard, you can make up atleast 7 days of the lost time: 10 + 10 + 20 = 40 hours worth of time. 

So just concentrate on making up those 40 hours worth of time.
